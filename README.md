# Full Stack Test

## About

This is my test of a full-stack system for my soil sensor project. On a raspberry pi I have an express api to take in data from moisture sensors, and a react app shows the output from the api.

When the react app doesn't read any data it will show the message "Failed to Connect!" and the gauges will read at 50%. Otherwise, there will be no error message and the gauges will show the moisture level each sensor detects.

*Demo will go here*
