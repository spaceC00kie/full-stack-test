# Full Stack Test

## About

This is my test of a full-stack system for my soil sensor project.

I have an express api to take in data from moisture sensors. A react app shows the output from the api.

## Credits

Thanks to Martin36 for creating the react component I used for my gauge. You can find the repository here: https://github.com/Martin36/react-gauge-chart
