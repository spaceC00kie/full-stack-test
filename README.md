# Full Stack Test

## About

This is my test of a full-stack system for my soil sensor project. An express api takes in data from moisture sensors and a react app shows the output from the api. Both run on a raspberry pi.

When the react app doesn't receive data it will show the message "Failed to Connect!" in a banner above the gauges and the gauges will read 50%. Otherwise, there will be no error message and the gauges will show the moisture level from each sensor.

*Demo will go here*
